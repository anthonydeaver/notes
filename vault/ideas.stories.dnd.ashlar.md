## Mission 1

Rumors of a new type of magicwielder are spreading through the land.The factions have called on you to look into the rumors, determin if there is any truth behind them, and if so, locate one and determine the threat posed.

### Rumors

The rumors about these new mages are conflidcting at best, and often unreliagle. However, several distinct stories have been repeated enough times by enough people to add some validity.
There are two that stand out from all the others:

- Some reports say that even though the spell casters used spells that have been seen before, the manager in which they were cast was unique. Instead of manipulated the web as most magic users do, these mages instead seemed to be pulling energy from a talisman (pendant, bracelet, even a weapon in some cases) and manipulating it into the spell. If true, then anyone who got ahold of one of the objects could potentially be dangerous.
- The second report says that any of these magic casters who were targeted by any spell seemed to not be as affected as one would think. Several simply shrugged off some of the less powerful spells. One thing of particular note was that any spells that targeted objects or the area around these new mages did appear to produce the full effect.

Both of the reports are true. The new mages are known as the Ashlar. Somewhere in their history their genetic code was changed, they are cut off from the [[Weave | https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Weave]].
They are unable to control and manipulate the Weave at all. Anyone who is able to see the Weave and how it interconnects everything in the world. The Ashlar do not register.
Over the years the Ashlar learned ways to store energy in 'prepared' objects. They are then able to withdraw that energy and manipulate it into a spell.
It takes a couple hours each day to recharge the talisman.
Spells that produce area effects such as `Erupting Earth` or `Fireball` _do_ affect the Ashlar.

Investigating the rumors lears the adventurers to a group of 'traders'[^1]

Traders reveal the Ashlar escaped using magic, they didn't know the Ashlar.

[^1]: the traders are slavers who acquired the Ashlar near Calimshan and brought them to Waterdeep

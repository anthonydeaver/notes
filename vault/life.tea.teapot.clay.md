#### Size

The first thing to consider when looking for a teapot is to select the right size of teapot to suit the number of people you will be making tea for most of the time. Teapots come in a variety of sizes but can be generally grouped the following way:

**Chart - Teapot Sizes for Number of People Served**

| Size of Teapot | Volume of Teapot (ml / fl oz) (approximate) | Number of People Served |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| #1 size        | 70 ml / 2.4 fl oz                           | 1 – 2 people            |
| # 2 size       | 100 ml / 3.4 fl oz                          | 2 – 4 people            |
| # 3 size       | 175 ml / 6.0 fl oz                          | 3 – 5 people            |
| # 4 size       | 225 ml / 7.6 fl oz                          | 4 – 6 people            |

#### Shape

The different shapes of teapots allow for the different types of leaves to expand in their own unique way to maximize the surface area exposed to water while brewing inside the teapot. Teapots come in 2 basic profiles: high profile and low profile and each is suited to a number of teas.

A Decorative Teapot (Low Profile)

Collecting interesting looking teapots can be an enjoyable and rewarding hobby but one should not confuse a good tea-making teapot with a decorative one. Notice that all the shapes above except for the decorative one follow very simple designs. The reason for the lack of ornamentation is because tea is very sensitive to heat fluctuations and the best teapots distribute heat evenly. Decorations create different densities in the teapot, which can create hot and cool spots. Another reason is that with Gong Fu Cha, hot water is poured over a teapot during brewing and the water will be deflected by awkward angles, creating further hot and cool spots inside the teapot during brewing.

## Part 1: The Goal
What is the goal for the next session and what is the motivation for achieving that goal

- part of a large goal?

## Part 2: The Details
Remind the players of everything important that came after the party started the adventure. Remind them of anything that came in the past and is important NOW.

## Part 3: Pick up as...
Where is the party right now and what are they about to do

Basically, for every piece of information in the recap, ask  “would the players say ‘holy crap, I’m so glad we remembered that or else we’d be toast right now.’” Experiences with ongoing threats or obstacles that are going to continue to be an issue, clues or information vital to solving the mystery, steps taken toward the goal, that kind of thing is important.

And remember, if it isn’t important in THIS session, it isn’t important. You can always remind the players about the goblin tactics in future adventures when they come back. If there aren’t any goblins tonight, don’t sweat it.
